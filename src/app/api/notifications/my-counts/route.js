/**
 * GET /api/notifications/my-counts
 *
 * Returns badge counts for the authenticated user, broken down per role:
 *
 *  - assignedArticles: # of articles assigned to me (as editor OR researcher)
 *                      that still need work. For editors → pending articles
 *                      in the queue. For researchers → assigned articles
 *                      that are not yet certified.
 *  - assignedTrials:   # of trials assigned to me as a researcher that are
 *                      not yet verified.
 *  - total:            sum of the above (used for the top-level badge)
 *
 * Responses are user-specific and never cached.
